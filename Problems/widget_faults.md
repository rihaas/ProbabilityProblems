# Widget Fault Probability

## Problem Description

A company manufactures widgets, and historically, 8% of the widgets are faulty. A quality control inspector randomly selects a batch of 75 widgets. What is the probability that precisely 3 widgets in the batch are faulty?

## Explanation

This problem can be solved using the **binomial distribution**. The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of a given number of "successes" in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes, "success" (in this case, a faulty widget) or "failure" (a non-faulty widget), and the probability of success is constant throughout the trials.
